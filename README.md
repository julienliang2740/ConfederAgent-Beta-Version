# ConfederAgent: Using AI and Large Language Models to Simulate Parliamentary Processes

**How do laws emerge from debate, persuasion and compromise?**
From the Ekklesia and Boule of Ancient Athens to the Parliaments and Congresses of the world today, legislative bodies have shaped the trajectory of human society. **ConfederAgent** brings this process to life through a multi-agent AI simulation powered by the latest advancements in large language models. The model explores the dynamic world of parliamentary politics: alliances, debates, negotiations, voting, and so much more. 

In this system, AI agents represent political parties with affiliations, ideological leanings, voter bases, and political goals. They engage in structured debate sessions and propose legislation based on the ever-changing circumstances. They respond to procedural constraints, form alliances, and vote on legislation - all within the simulated parliament. The simulation supports a variety of parliamentary formats, including majority rule systems, multi-party coalitions and issue-based caucuses.

ConfederAgent is not just a demonstration of AI capability â€” it is a research tool for studying the emergence of consensus, polarization, and political strategy. By evaluating these interactions, we aim to explore the potential of LLM-based systems to model real-world governance and collective decision-making. The insights drawn from these simulations have implications for political science, AI alignment, and the future of human-AI collaboration in democratic processes.


## Demo Video
The included demo video showcases ConfederAgent in action through a fictional scenario set in a galaxy far, far away (but not so long ago). In this simulation, representatives from various star systems engage in heated parliamentary debate over interstellar trade, defence pacts, and labour regulations. Though the setting is science fiction, the underlying mechanics mirror real-world legislative processes to illustrate how AI agents can model complex political discourse, alliance building, and policy negotiations.

(There is also a 12 round demo [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4ANbmolILROHiIIw0mO2nmyaSbfbjn0/view?usp=sharing) that was too large to upload to GitHub)
