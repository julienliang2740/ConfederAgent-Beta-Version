# ConfederAgent: Using AI and Large Language Models to Simulate Parliamentary Processes

**How do laws emerge from debate, persuasion and compromise?**
From Ekklesia and Boule of Ancient Athens to the Parliaments and Congresses of the world today, legislative bodies have shaped the trajectory of human society. **ConfederAgent** brings this process to life through a multi-agent AI simulation powered by the latest advancements in large language models. The model explores the dynamic world of parliamentary politics: alliances, debates, negotiations, voting, and so much more.
